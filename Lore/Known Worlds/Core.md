# Introduction

The Core is the central world in the pantheon of known worlds, often regarded as the linchpin holding the delicate fabric of reality together. It is primarily a human world, although it harbors ancient secrets and esoteric arts that make it far more than a simple homeland for mankind.

## Geography

The Core is a world of contrasts: vast, arid deserts co-exist with lush, evergreen forests, and towering mountain ranges give way to sprawling urban landscapes. The rivers emanate from a mysterious source known as the "Primordial Well," believed to be a direct link to the fundamental energies of the universe.

## Governance

### Federal Structure

The Core operates on a federal structure, with multiple sovereign states governed by local rulers. These states share a common constitution, which is interpreted and enforced by a High Council.

### High Council

Comprised of representatives from each state, the High Council is the ultimate authority for inter-state issues, international relations, and especially, interactions with other worlds. The Council is also responsible for maintaining the Core's Collective Defense Force (CDF).

## Military

### Collective Defense Force (CDF)

The CDF is a joint military force responsible for the Core's extra-world operations. It's a hub of technological innovation, magical expertise, and is often the first line of defense against cosmic threats.

### Specialized Forces

Certain states contribute specialized forces that deal with specific types of threats. For example, the "Warp Navigators" are an elite group trained to navigate the Astral Warp safely.

## Culture

### Unity and Division

While there's a shared cultural history that binds the Core, regional variations abound. Each state has its own customs, practices, and even dialects. However, the threat of cosmic imbalance often serves as a unifying force.

### Sacred Arts

The Core is also the cradle of esoteric and arcane knowledge. The art of "Dreamwalking" originated here and has evolved into a highly-regulated practice monitored by the High Council.

## Economy

### Resource Pooling

Being the hub of multiple worlds has its advantages. The Core has access to resources from various connected worlds, which are pooled together and allocated based on the High Council's decisions.

### Trade

Trade between states and other worlds is heavily regulated but incredibly lucrative. Specialized agencies oversee these exchanges to ensure they align with the Core's overall interests.

## Cosmic Role

The Core serves as a kind of "anchor" for the known worlds, its stability directly affecting the stability of other realities. Any significant imbalance in the Core could have catastrophic consequences across the cosmic landscape.

# Gods of the Core

## Introduction

The Core, despite its central place in the cosmological order, is a land fraught with religious tension and divine conflict. The original pantheon consisted of four major gods: Dio, Echo, Shar, and Tyr. They were once mortals who ascended to godhood through the mysterious feat of vanquishing a World Serpent and consuming its celestial blood.

## [[Dio]]: God of Life

Dio was the central figure of the Core's pantheon, symbolizing the generative forces of life and vitality. Under his guidance, the Core was named and positioned as the focal point of the universe. However, his recent death has disrupted the religious stability and fueled the emergence of new cults and sects.

## [[Echo]]: Goddess of Magic

Echo embodies the arcane and mystical arts. She is the keeper of magical secrets and the patron of Dreamwalkers. Echo has vehemently opposed the Coalition and their machinations, which has led to the suppression of her worship and the persecution of her followers.

## [[Shar]]: Goddess of Darkness

Shar stands as a complex figure who personifies the veil of darkness and the unknown. Interestingly, Shar has aligned herself with the Coalition, resulting in a surge in her worship and influence.

## [[Tyr]]: Goddess of Light

Tyr, the sister of Shar, represents light, justice, and order. She has always stood in opposition to the Coalition's plans and has tried to thwart them at every turn. This resistance has resulted in the outlawing of her worship and the dismantling of her temples.

## Religious Tensions

### New Sects and Cults

With Dio's death, the religious landscape has changed drastically. New sects have emerged that deviate from traditional doctrines, while the older religious orders have become even more radicalized.

### The Coalition's Influence

Aligned with Shar, the Coalition promotes the worship of [[The Trinity]]â€”[[Bane]], [[Bhaal]], and [[Zariel]]. Bane has been reinvented as a successor to Dio, emphasizing a natural transition from life to death. Zariel's worship has also been pushed due to her domain over war, which aligns with the Coalition's martial ambitions.

### Persecution

The religious turmoil has resulted in the vandalization of Echo and Tyr's temples, and their worshipers have been subject to public humiliation and even execution.
