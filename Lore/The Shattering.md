As the last desperate act of his rule [[Darian Dusklight]] called for the forces of warp to destroy the uprising. And the forces of warp answered. They told him of the dark ritual which will temporarily stabilize [[The Rift]] and allow [[The Coalition]] forces through. The sacrifice to achieve such feat, however would be drastic: [[Dio]], the God of Life himself.

Together with [[The Trinity]], [[Shar]] and [[Coalition Leadership]] they devised a plot to murder the God of Life. 

// Add details about the plot

Dio's persistence, inherited from the world-eating serpent, means that his divine essence continuously attempts to reconstitute itself. The Trinity, aware of this, must engage in a perpetual ritual of sacrifice to keep him at bay. They require an enormous, ever-renewing source of souls to sustain the ritual.

When the Coalition forged their alliance with The Trinity, they offered a solution: periodic mass sacrifices from worlds within the known realms. Each time a world's population is sacrificed, it buys The Trinity more time to consolidate their power and keep Dio's resurgence at bay.
