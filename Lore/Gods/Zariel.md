**Zariel's World - "Carnagea":** A world of perpetual warfare, where each nation is in a constant state of battle. Zariel was a mortal general, unmatched in tactical brilliance. She stumbled upon an artifact that drew upon the Astral energies, enabling her to win the unwinnable war. Yet, the artifact was not just a weapon, but a link to the Warp. By utilizing it, she disrupted the natural balance, which eventually led to the artifact consuming the souls of the fallen, and bestowing her with divine status. She became the Goddess of War, but her world remained in an endless loop of conflict.
