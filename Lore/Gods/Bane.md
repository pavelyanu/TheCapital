**Bane's World - "Oblivion":** Bane was an apocalyptic prophet, preaching the end of times. However, unlike other doomsayers, he had the means to bring about this end. Through dark rituals and pacts with entities from the Warp, Bane unleashed a calamity that obliterated every living being, leaving a void world behind. With the mass extinction, an immense influx of souls propelled him into godhood, making him the God of Death.
