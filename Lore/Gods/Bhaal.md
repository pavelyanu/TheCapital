1. **Human Victims**: He starts off as a killer of men, but soon finds that taking human life no longer satisfies his insatiable itch.
    
2. **Elementals & Magical Beasts**: Unsatisfied, he sets his sights on killing more complex, magical beings like elementals, dragons, and other mythical creatures. The bigger the challenge, the more fulfilling the kill. Yet, even these extraordinary beings soon become insufficient.
    
3. **First Divine Kill - "A forgotten nymph deity of nature":** His first divine kill was a lesser god tied to a secluded forest. Killing this deity did nothing to make him more powerful, but the thrill, the high was unparalleled.
    
4. **Journey to [[Dio]]**: Bhaal, in a perpetual quest for that elusive 'high', killed various minor deities—each progressively more potent but still lacking. He dabbled in killing gods of justice, chaos, love—each providing a fleeting satisfaction that dissipated all too quickly.
    
5. **Alliance with [[Trinity]] and Coalition**: Eventually, his path crossed with the Coalition and the Trinity. The prospect of killing Dio, the paramount deity, promised to be the ultimate high—the final itch to scratch.
    
6. **Killing [[Dio]]**: His life's sole ambition was realized when he struck down Dio. He felt the thrill, that rush like never before. But like all highs, even this one was destined to fade, leaving him with a void he could never fill.
