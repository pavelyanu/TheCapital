#### Act I: The Birth of Rebellion

The Whirlwind emerges as a protest movement against the declining Dusklight Dynasty. Demands for democratic reforms and better living conditions grow louder.

#### Act II: From Protests to Uprising

The Whirlwind escalates its activities from peaceful protests to violent actions. The monarch, Verian, weak and ill, does nothing, further aggravating the people.

#### Act III: The Opening of the Rift

Renegade Dreamwalkers within the Whirlwind, tired of slow progress, conduct a secret ritual to harness the Warp's energies. A miscalculation occurs, and the Rift is opened.

#### Act IV: The Fall of the Dynasty

The royal forces, already stretched thin and demoralized, fail to contain the chaos unleashed by the Rift. Verian passes away during this period, causing the complete collapse of royal authority. The Whirlwind seizes the Capital.

#### Act V: The Brief Democratic Dawn

For a fleeting moment, the people taste freedom. A democratic council forms, made up of Whirlwind leaders and other notables. Reforms are passed in haste, and there's a feeling of a new era dawning.

#### Act VI: The Arrival of the Coalition

Just as the fledgling democracy starts to take shape, [[The Coalition]] performs [[The Shattering]] and invades through the [[Rift]]. They swiftly crush the unprepared and fragmented resistance, bringing an end to the short-lived democratic experiment.

#### Act VII: The New Order

The Coalition establishes a puppet regime, executes or assimilates surviving Whirlwind members, and firmly asserts its rule. The Capital and the Lands in Between fall under a dark shadow, as the puppet government begins a harsh rule, enforced by Coalition troops.
