### Ascension and the First Magic

[[Echo]], [[Dio]], [[Shar]] and [[Tyr]], originally mortals from one of the [[Core]], achieved godhood by vanquishing and consuming the blood of a massive serpent residing within [[The Astral Warp]]. Echo's spellwork sealed the serpent's body, preventing divine influences and creating a stable pocket in the Astral Warp known as the Lands In Between. These islands are actually segments of the celestial serpent's body.
### Discovery and Settlement

#### Planeshifters 
Planeshifters, beings with the unique ability to traverse different dimensions, were the first to settle these islands, attracted by its divine void.
#### The Founding of [[The Capital]]
Ruled by a royal dynasty originating from one of the [[Core]], the Capital was established as the administrative and magical center of the Lands In Between.
