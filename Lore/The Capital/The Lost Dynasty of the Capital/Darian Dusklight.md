The second child, Darian, was always in the shadow of Elysia. He was adept at political maneuvering but lacked significant skill in Astral arts. Discontent grew in him, and he began forming alliances with shadowy entities from the Warp, entertaining the idea of a pact that could give him the edge he so desperately wanted.

Darian, the ambitious and reckless son, assumed the administrative responsibilities in the absence of his father and sister. His heavy-handed rule only fanned the flames of rebellion. Desperate to maintain power, Darian struck a Faustian bargain with malevolent entities from the Warp, enabling the Coalition to come kill Dio and go through the Rift in hopes they would install him as a puppet ruler. The plan backfired. The Coalition, reading the volatile public sentiment against him, publicly executed Darian to secure their own authority.
