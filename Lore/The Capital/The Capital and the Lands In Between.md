### Introduction
The Capital serves as the main city within the Lands In Between, an archipelago located in a stabilized zone of the Astral Warp. The Lands In Between represent an anomalous, yet harmonious blend of divine restrictions, mortal ambition, and interdimensional interests.

### Cosmology & Origin

#### Ascension and the First Magic
[[Echo]], [[Dio]], [[Shar]] and [[Tyr]], originally mortals from one of the [[Core]], achieved godhood by vanquishing and consuming the blood of a massive serpent residing within [[The Astral Warp]]. Echo's spellwork sealed the serpent's body, preventing divine influences and creating a stable pocket in the Astral Warp known as the Lands In Between. These islands are actually segments of the celestial serpent's body.
### Discovery and Settlement

#### Planeshifters 
Planeshifters, beings with the unique ability to traverse different dimensions, were the first to settle these islands, attracted by its divine void.

#### The Founding of The Capital
Ruled by a royal dynasty originating from one of the Known Worlds, the Capital was established as the administrative and magical center of the Lands In Between.

### Crisis and Transition

#### The Rift and the Invasion
An ill-conceived coup weakened Nia's seal, leading to an influx of Warp entities. 

#### Coalition Invasion
The Coalition, an alliance of forces from various dimensions, exploited this instability to seize the Lands In Between, including the Capital.

### Magic and Governance

#### Dreamwalkers
Dreamwalkers are the broad category of magic-users trained to manipulate the energies of the Astral Warp. They mitigate the mental toll of their practices by retreating to specialized chambers known as "Sanity Wells."

#### Planeshifters in Modern Times
While some Dreamwalkers gain the rare skill of planeshifting, Planeshifters as a whole include various beings with this unique capability, irrespective of their magical abilities.
